            <p class="py-3">Among the easiest and least expensive of cosmetic dental procedures, Teeth fixing can repair 
            chipped or cracked teeth, close gaps, change the shape of teeth, 
            or be used as a cosmetic alternative to silver amalgam fillings.</p>

            <h2 class="display-4">Implantation</h2>
            <p class="py-3">A dental implant is a surgical fixture that is placed into the jawbone and allowed 
            to fuse with the bone over the span of a few months. The dental implant acts as a replacement for 
            the root of a missing tooth. In turn, this "artificial tooth root" serves to hold a replacement tooth or bridge. 
            Having a dental implant fused to the jawbone is the closest thing to mimicking a natural tooth because it stands on 
            its own without affecting the nearby teeth and has great stability. The process of fusion between the dental implant and 
            jawbone is called "osseointegration." Most dental implants are made of titanium, which allows them to integrate with bone
             without being recognized as a foreign object in our body. Over time, technology and science have progressed to greatly 
             improve the outcomes of dental implant placement. .</p>

            <p class="py-3">Scaling is when your dentist removes all the plaque and tartar (hardened plaque) 
            above and below the gumline, making sure to clean all the way down to the bottom of the pocket. 
            Your dentist will then begin root planing, 
            smoothing out your teeth roots to help your gums reattach to your teeth.</p>

            <p class="py-3">Healthy teeth are important to your child’s overall health. 
            They help your child eat and talk. Strong oral care helps set good dental habits as your child grows.
             Poor oral care can lead to infection, disease, or other teeth problems.<br>

            <p class="py-3">Root canal therapy is a dental procedure which helps in removing the entire internal parts, mainly pulp chamber of the tooth. 
            It also involves the filling of the prepared empty cavity with a suitable bio-compatible material. </p>

            <p class="py-3">If you have missing teeth, our DOctor can close — or bridge — the gaps in your smile with dental bridges. A dental bridge is a false tooth (called a pontic) that is held in place by the abutment teeth on either side of the gap. Although pontics can be made from a variety of materials such as gold, 
            typically they’re made from porcelain to aesthetically blend in with your natural teeth.</p>

            <h2 class="display-4">Impaction</h2>
            <p class="py-3">An impacted tooth is one that fails to erupt into the dental arch within the
             expected developmental window. Because impacted teeth do not erupt, they are retained throughout the individual's
              lifetime unless extracted or exposed surgically. Teeth may become impacted because of adjacent teeth, dense overlying bone, 
              
            excessive soft tissue or a genetic abnormality. Most often, the cause of impaction is inadequate arch length and space in
             which to erupt. That is the total length of the alveolar arch is smaller than the tooth arch 
             
             (the combined mesiodistal width of each tooth). The wisdom teeth (third molars) are frequently impacted because
              they are the last teeth to erupt in the oral cavity.

            <h2 class="display-4">Braces</h2>
            <p class="py-3">Dental braces (also known as braces, orthodontic cases, or cases) are devices used in orthodontics that align and straighten teeth and help position them with regard to a person's bite, while also aiming to improve dental health. Braces also fix gaps. They are often used to correct underbites, as well as malocclusions, overbites, open bites, deep bites, cross bites, crooked teeth, and various other flaws of the teeth and jaw. Braces can be either cosmetic or structural. Dental braces are often used in conjunction with other orthodontic appliances to help widen the palate
             or jaws and to otherwise assist in shaping the teeth and jaws</p>

            <p class="py-3">The process of tooth whitening lightens the colour of a tooth. Tooth whitening can be achieved by either changing the intrinsic colour or by removing and controlling the formation of extrinsic stains. The chemical degradation of the chromogens within or on the tooth is termed as bleaching. </p>
